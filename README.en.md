A ChatGPT, Claude Code, or OpenCode run takes ten minutes to an hour, and it keeps you chained to your desk. **Pocket Agent brings all three to your phone**: step away and still watch them work, approve commands, send new instructions — and the moment a task finishes, it pings you.

It talks to your existing, unmodified local CLIs — `codex` for ChatGPT, `claude` for Claude Code, and `opencode` for OpenCode. Pocket Agent bridges every detected backend to your phone over an end-to-end-encrypted, zero-knowledge relay.

> [!TIP]
> **Not tied to any one browser**: any phone browser works; task notifications are sent through the JingMe robot.

## ✨ Why from your phone

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🔔 It pings you
When a task finishes or needs approval, configured channels push a notification to your phone.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 📱 Tap to take over
Open the deep link from a notification in your phone's browser (including a messenger's in-app browser): read the conversation, approve commands, send new instructions, switch models — all from your phone. No app, no SSH.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🔒 Encryption still holds
Some mobile / in-app browser engines lack WebCrypto's X25519. Pocket Agent ships a **pure-JS fallback** that kicks in automatically when the native primitive is missing, so end-to-end encryption is never weakened.

## 🚀 Features

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 📱 **Remote takeover from your phone** | Read the conversation, approve commands/diffs, start new turns, switch model and reasoning effort, interrupt the current turn |
| 🧠 **Three agent backends** | ChatGPT is the default backend; installed Claude Code and OpenCode CLIs appear as additional switchable agents |
| ⌨️ **Terminal Mode** | Open a real terminal window on your computer from your phone (full-fidelity xterm.js) — run Claude Code / OpenCode / Codex / Gemini CLI or any shell remotely; sessions survive phone lock-screens and daemon restarts |
| 🔔 **Push notifications** | Pushed to your phone when a task finishes or blocks on approval; the deep link jumps straight to that session |
| 🔒 **End-to-end encryption** | X25519 + HKDF-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM; the zero-knowledge relay never sees your code, commands, or conversation |
| 👀 **Read-only sharing** | Generate a read-only link to a single session to share an agent at work; viewers can watch and applaud but never enter your context |
| 🖥️ **Multi-machine** | Manage ChatGPT / Claude Code / OpenCode on several computers from one phone |
| 🧩 **Zero-dep · self-hostable** | The daemon has zero npm dependencies; use a hosted relay or self-host it with one command |

## 🏁 Quick start

### One-command install

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/iAmbitions/CXX/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
irm https://github.com/iAmbitions/CXX/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer downloads the latest GitHub Release and verifies `checksums.txt`.

- **macOS**: installs to `/Applications`; open the menu-bar app to pair.
- **Linux** (CLI, no tray): installs `~/.local/bin/cxx`, then `cxx enable` → `cxx pair` (open the JSON `url` on your phone). To keep the daemon after SSH logout: `loginctl enable-linger $USER`.
- **Windows**: run the setup, then open **Pocket Agent** from the tray to pair.

Package downloads: [Pocket-Agent-macos.dmg](https://github.com/iAmbitions/CXX/releases/latest/download/Pocket-Agent-macos.dmg) · [Pocket-Agent-win-x64.exe](https://github.com/iAmbitions/CXX/releases/latest/download/Pocket-Agent-win-x64.exe) · [cxx-linux-x64](https://github.com/iAmbitions/CXX/releases/latest/download/cxx-linux-x64) · [cxx-linux-arm64](https://github.com/iAmbitions/CXX/releases/latest/download/cxx-linux-arm64)

### Pairing

> [!NOTE]
> **macOS / Windows** ship a menu-bar / tray shell; **Linux is CLI + systemd** (no tray). The phone side is a web page — iOS, Android, and any in-app browser all work.

**Desktop (macOS / Windows)**

1. **Launch the menu-bar / tray app**. Remote is off on first run; the UI follows your system language.
2. Click the icon → **Pair a device…**: the first click turns remote on (installs the keepalive service and starts the daemon) → **shows the pairing QR**.
3. **Scan to pair** — credentials stay encrypted on the phone, so later visits skip the scan.
4. **Go remote**: view and take over ChatGPT / Claude Code / OpenCode sessions from your phone.

**Linux (CLI)**

1. `cxx enable` — write a systemd user unit and start the daemon.  
2. `cxx pair` — JSON with a permanent `url`; open it on your phone. Use `cxx pair-once` for a 5-minute one-shot link.  
3. `cxx status` / `cxx devices` / `cxx notify …` for ops and notification channels.

> [!TIP]
> Pin the page to your home screen or keep the chat handy, then jump back to your workspace from anywhere to keep watching tasks, approving, and issuing commands.

### Notification channels

Pushed to your phone when a task finishes or blocks on approval. Configure your JingMe ERP recipient:

```bash
cxx notify --add jingme --erp <your-ERP>  # add a JingMe robot recipient
cxx notify --test                         # send a test notification
cxx notify --list                         # list recipients
```

OneBot 11 uses NapCat's **HTTP server**, not its HTTP client. When Pocket Agent and NapCat run on the same server, bind NapCat to `127.0.0.1` and use `http://127.0.0.1:4531/send_msg`; for separate hosts, bind NapCat to `0.0.0.0`, use its server address, and protect the endpoint with a token and firewall allowlist. `--target` accepts `private:<QQ number>` or `group:<group number>`. Messages are sent as plain strings without changing Pocket Agent's existing notification content. NapCat is a third-party QQ protocol implementation; Pocket Agent only provides the integration and does not bundle NapCat.

> [!NOTE]
> `cxx` is the global command the installer (DMG / Windows setup) drops onto your PATH — it points at the same background binary inside the app. `cxx pair`, `cxx status`, `cxx devices`, etc. all work; run `cxx help` for the full list. Running from source, replace `cxx` with `node daemon/src/main.mjs`.

> [!WARNING]
> Notifications carry only a **summary** (event type + session name), never raw commands, code, or file paths — third-party push channels are plaintext, so this is a deliberate security constraint.

### Terminal Mode (optional)

Beyond structured sessions, your phone can also take over a **real terminal**: pick **Terminal** in the agent selector (top left) → **New Window**, and a terminal window opens on your computer, driven from your phone. Launch presets include Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, or a plain shell. The screen is rendered with xterm.js at full fidelity (ANSI / TUI / Vim all work), with two input modes: instruction mode (adapted to phone typing) and keyboard mode (raw keystrokes).

- **Sessions outlive connections**: each terminal window is owned by a standalone `cxx-pty-host` process, so a phone lock-screen, a dropped connection, or even a daemon auto-update restart never kills the task inside; the screen resumes when you come back.
- **Notification loop**: a terminal bell, process exit, or prolonged silence pushes through the notification channels above, and the deep link lands you in that terminal.
- **Off by default, double opt-in**: open the menu-bar → **Terminal Mode…** to flip the global switch and authorize devices one by one (headless: `cxx terminal-enable 1` + `cxx terminal-access <deviceId> 1`). Read-only share links can never use the terminal; only one device can write to a window at a time — other authorized devices watch read-only and can explicitly take over.

### CLI cheat-sheet

Day to day the menu-bar icon is enough; on a headless Mac / server the global `cxx` command (dropped on PATH by the installer) is the full entry point (`cxx help` for everything):

```bash
# Remote service
cxx enable | disable | status        # enable autostart & run / stop & disable / show status
# Pairing & devices
cxx pair                             # generate a one-time pairing QR / link
cxx devices                          # list paired devices
cxx revoke <deviceId>                # revoke a device
# Notifications (see previous section)
cxx notify --list | --test | --add … # manage channels
# Terminal Mode
cxx terminal-status                  # global switch, per-device access, running windows
cxx terminal-enable 1|0              # turn Terminal Mode on / off
cxx terminal-access <deviceId> 1|0   # grant / revoke terminal access for a device
cxx terminal-close <terminalId>      # close a terminal window
# Misc
cxx version                          # print version
```

### For developers: run from source

Requires Node ≥ 22 and an installed official `codex` CLI **≥ 0.142** (verify with `codex --version`). The daemon checks the `codex` version at startup and refuses to run against an older one, since the experimental `app-server` protocol it depends on is only validated from 0.142 up.

Claude Code and OpenCode are optional: when the daemon finds `claude` (version ≥ 2.0.0) or `opencode`, it automatically registers the corresponding agent. Missing backends are simply omitted from the phone UI. OpenCode uses the official `opencode serve` HTTP/SSE API bound only to `127.0.0.1`.

```bash
# 1. start a local relay
node relay/node/server.mjs --port 8787

# 2. start the daemon (first run generates keys + daemonId under ~/.cxx/remote/)
node daemon/src/main.mjs start --relay ws://127.0.0.1:8787

# 3. issue a pairing link (in another terminal)
node daemon/src/main.mjs pair

# 4. open the printed link on your phone
```

End-to-end smoke test (spins up relay + daemon + a simulated client and asserts the ChatGPT chain, using your real `codex` binary):

```bash
npm run smoke
```

Because `app-server` is experimental upstream, Pocket Agent guards against protocol drift: `npm run check:schema` exports the official app-server JSON Schema and compares it to a committed fingerprint (`daemon/schema/manifest.json`), failing on any change. After reviewing an intended change, refresh the baseline with `npm run check:schema:update`. CI runs the smoke test against the pinned minimum codex on every push. A daily `codex@latest` job records schema drift as a warning and uses the end-to-end smoke test as the compatibility gate, so harmless upstream schema additions do not generate repeated failure emails.

## 🧭 How it works

The official ChatGPT `codex` CLI already ships `app-server` and `remote-control` subcommands, but app-server binds to `localhost` only (the official path is SSH port-forwarding) — no relay traversal, no phone side. Claude Code does not expose an equivalent persistent app-server. **Pocket Agent adds the remote-control layer for both: ChatGPT through `codex app-server`, Claude Code through local session JSONL plus the headless CLI — and Terminal Mode through a standalone `cxx-pty-host` PTY host.**

```

- **daemon** — spawns the official `codex app-server --listen` and registers Claude Code when the `claude` CLI is available; connects outbound to a relay; handles pairing, device management, end-to-end encryption (X25519 + HKDF-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM), live session streaming, and JingMe robot notifications. Zero npm dependencies.
- **relay** — a zero-knowledge forwarder (matches daemon↔client by `daemonId`, forwards opaque encrypted frames, holds no keys). Runs as a Cloudflare Worker or a single Node process.
- **web** — the phone-side page (vanilla JS + WebCrypto, no build step; falls back to a pure-JS X25519 when the browser engine lacks it).
- **shell** — a thin native menu-bar / tray app (macOS Swift, Windows tray). A pure view: the daemon is owned by the OS keepalive service (launchd / Task Scheduler), and the shell shells out to `cxx-daemon <subcommand>` per action — quitting the tray leaves remote running. **Linux has no shell**: the same `cxx` CLI plus a systemd `--user` unit.
- **pty-host** — the PTY host behind Terminal Mode (a static Go binary): one standalone process per terminal window, holding the unix PTY / Windows ConPTY and a 256 KiB replay buffer. The daemon talks to it over local IPC and re-attaches after an update restart, so tasks inside the terminal never die with the daemon.

Everything is end-to-end encrypted: the daemon holds a long-term key whose public half ships with the pairing code; each phone connection generates an ephemeral key, both sides derive the session key independently, and the relay only ferries ciphertext it can't read. Full protocol in [public/PROTOCOL.md](./public/PROTOCOL.md).

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does Pocket Agent include ChatGPT / Claude Code / OpenCode?</b></summary>

No. Pocket Agent is a remote takeover enhancement tool; it depends on `codex` or `claude` already being installed and logged in on your computer. ChatGPT is the default backend; when a usable Claude Code CLI is detected, the phone UI automatically shows Claude Code as a switchable agent.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I have to modify or replace ChatGPT / Claude Code / OpenCode?</b></summary>

No. For ChatGPT, Pocket Agent talks to the official, unpatched `codex` CLI and runs its own `app-server` instance on a separate port, so it won't fight the official `remote-control` for the control socket. For Claude Code, Pocket Agent calls your local `claude` CLI and reads Claude Code's own session files; it does not patch Claude Code.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will Terminal Mode take over terminals I already have open in iTerm / Terminal?</b></summary>

No. Terminal Mode only controls terminal windows that Pocket Agent creates itself; it never attaches to existing processes in other terminal apps (that isn't technically possible either). It is off by default and requires both the global switch and per-device authorization on the computer. Every phone-initiated terminal is visible in the menu bar and can be closed from the computer at any time, and read-only share links can never use the terminal.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can the relay see my code, commands, or conversation?</b></summary>

No. All application-layer content is end-to-end encrypted between the daemon and your phone. The relay is a zero-knowledge forwarder — it holds no keys or tokens and only matches by `daemonId` and ferries ciphertext frame by frame. See [public/SECURITY.md](./public/SECURITY.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why does macOS ask to let “cxx-daemon” find devices on the local network, and why does the green dot become a WiFi icon?</b></summary>

Pocket Agent is trying to upgrade the relay connection to a WebRTC peer-to-peer link when your phone and computer share the same WiFi. The green dot means the relay connection is working; after local-network access is allowed and the direct link succeeds, it becomes a WiFi icon and data travels directly over the LAN, while the relay stays connected for signaling and fallback. Denying access does not break Pocket Agent — it keeps using the end-to-end encrypted relay and shows the green dot. Pocket Agent does not scan a device list; this permission is only used to connect to the paired phone.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do notifications and the UI reach my phone?</b></summary>

Notifications are sent through the JingMe robot. Tap the deep link and the phone (or in-app) browser opens the Pocket Agent page to take over. Notifications contain only a summary, never sensitive content.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Which desktop OSes? Do iOS / Android work?</b></summary>

The phone side is a web page, so **any phone browser (including a messenger's in-app browser) works** — iOS and Android alike. On the computer: **macOS / Windows** ship a tray shell + daemon; **Linux is CLI + systemd user service** (no tray/GUI), aimed at servers and multi-agent hosts. The daemon and protocol are cross-platform.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>On Linux, does the daemon stop when SSH disconnects?</b></summary>

By default a systemd **user** unit may stop when the last session ends. To keep it running after logout, run `loginctl enable-linger $USER` once. Logs live at `~/.cxx/remote/daemon.log`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My phone's in-app browser lacks some crypto — will it fail to connect?</b></summary>

No. Many mobile / in-app browser engines don't support WebCrypto's X25519; Pocket Agent ships a cross-verified pure-JS fallback that engages automatically when the native primitive is unavailable, so end-to-end encryption still holds.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it cost anything?</b></summary>

The project is MIT open source. Use the hosted public relay, or self-host it with one command (Cloudflare Worker or a single Node process).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if I lose my phone or want to revoke a device?</b></summary>

Every device (isolated by browser + site — each of Chrome / Firefox / an in-app browser counts as one) holds its own token and can be revoked individually. Revocation is immediate: the daemon actively kicks the live connection instead of waiting for the next auth.

</details>

### 🔨 Building

```bash
npm run build:app                  # macOS: assembles dist/口袋Agent.app (daemon + menu-bar shell, ad-hoc signed)
node scripts/build-app.mjs --dmg   # macOS: also produce a DMG
npm run build:sea                  # platform SEA binary → dist/sea/cxx-daemon (or .exe on Windows)
npm run build:linux                # alias of build:sea for Linux release builds
```

The first SEA build downloads an official Node runtime (Homebrew's node lacks the SEA fuse) and caches it under `dist/.node-cache`. See [shell/macos/README.md](./shell/macos/README.md) for macOS dev-run instructions and the shell↔daemon backend-subcommand contract.
